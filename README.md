A Svelte action for Vest, that makes it easy to validate forms and show errors
when necessary â€” built with TypeScript.

Vest, in their own words is a "Declarative validations framework inspired by
unit testing libraries".

This svelte action aims to make it easy to use vest in your svelte forms to
validate your data and show errors. It will also wrap your call that submits the
data to your server and handle any errors that might happen there as well.

See it in action in this [Svelte
REPL](https://svelte.dev/repl/7094c5603d02477c8333ad42fc73c3d1?version=3.42.6)
or look at the example in [the example](./example/).

## Installation

```bash
npm install --save-prod use-vest
# or pnpmpnp
pnpm add use-vest
# or whatever package manager you like
```

## Usage

Let's assume you have finished [writing your
suite](https://vestjs.dev/docs/writing_your_suite/vests_suite) and have exported
the TypeScript type for your `FormData` (optional).

To see how you would incorporate `use-vest` in your form, look at the
[Form.svelte](./example/Form.svelte) file.

As you can see, `useVest` returns a few stores that hold information about the
current state of your form.

**But how do the individual input fields get their validation status?**

`useVest` sets up a [Svelte context](https://svelte.dev/tutorial/context-api)
(that is accessible to all children) where everything necessary to display the
input field state is stored.

Any input field inside the form simply uses [`getVestContext()`](./src/context.ts) to get the
correct context object, and this object will contain the validation result, as
well as information about the form in general.

To see how you can use that context, look at
[Input.svelte](./example/Input.svelte) and
[InputError.svelte](./example/InputError.svelte).
